This game created for the Internet Software Architecture course at BCIT. We were tasked to create a game similar to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNinYFJEAIM).

The game also keeps track of high scores and makes use of the free Heroku Postgres database, which doesn't work anymore unfortunately. :(

I wanted to challenge myself and make the application OOP as much as possible and using Canvas. It was a great learning experience to handle different game states to control game logic and rendering.
